=head1 ATTRIBUTES

All attributes beginning with C<tmp_> are reserved and must not be
defined by subclasses.  In addition, attributes beginning with
C<sort_> are reserved for indicating whether collected entries should
be sorted.

=attr tmp_collected

This is a hashref of arrayrefs.  The keys are the POD commands
returned by L</"collect_commands">, plus any format names that begin
with C<Pod::Loom>.  Each value is an arrayref of POD blocks.
It is filled in by the L</"parse_pod"> method.

=attr tmp_filename

This is the name of the file being processed.  This is only for
informational purposes; it need not represent an actual file on disk.
(The L</"weave"> method stores the filename here.)

=attr tmp_groups

This is a hashref of hashrefs.  The keys are the POD commands returned
by L</"collect_commands">, Each value is an hashref of group codes.
It is filled in by the L</"parse_pod"> method.

=cut

  is       => 'rw',

#---------------------------------------------------------------------
has _tmp_warned => (
  is       => 'rw',
  isa      => 'Bool',
);

=method warning

  $tmp->warning($message);

This method calls Perl's C<warn> builtin with the C<$message>.  If
this is the first warning, it first prints a warning with the filename.

=cut

sub warning
{
  my ($self, $message) = @_;

  unless ($self->_tmp_warned) {
    warn "While processing " . $self->tmp_filename . "\n";
    $self->_tmp_warned(1);
  }

  warn "  $message";
} # end warning

=method error

  $tmp->error($message);

This method calls Perl's C<die> builtin with the C<$message> after
prepending the filename to it.

=cut

sub error
{
  my ($self, $message) = @_;

  die 'Error procesing ' . $self->tmp_filename . "\n  $message";
} # end error

#---------------------------------------------------------------------
# These methods are likely to be overloaded in subclasses:

=method collect_commands

  $arrayRef = $tmp->collect_commands;

This method should be overriden in subclasses to indicate what POD
commands should be collected for the template to stitch together.
This should include C<head1>, or the template is unlikely to work
properly.  The default method indicates only C<head1> is collected.

=method override_section

  $boolean = $tmp->override_section($section_title);

Normally, if a section appears in the document, it remains unchanged
by the template.  However, a template may want to rewrite certain
sections.  C<override_section> is called when the specified section is
present in the document.  If it returns true, then the normal
C<section_TITLE> method will be called.  (If it returns true but the
C<section_TITLE> method doesn't exist, the section will be dropped.)

=attr sections

Subclasses must provide a builder for this attribute named
C<_build_sections>. It is an
arrayref of section titles in the order they should appear.  The
special title C<*> indicates where sections that appear in the
document but are not in this list will be placed.  (If C<*> is not in
this list, such sections will be dropped.)

The list can include sections that the template does not provide.  In
that case, it simply indicates where the section should be placed if
the document provides it.

=cut

sub collect_commands { [ 'head1' ] }
sub override_section { 0 }

has sections => (
  is       => 'ro',
  isa      => 'ArrayRef[Str]',
  required => 1,
  builder  => '_build_sections',
);

#---------------------------------------------------------------------

=method expect_sections

  $section_titles = $tmp->expect_sections;

This method returns an arrayref containing the section titles in the
order they should appear.  By default, this is the list from
L</"sections">, but it can be overriden by the document:

If the document contains C<=for Pod::Loom-sections>, the sections
listed there (one per line) replace the template's normal section
list.

If the document contains C<=for Pod::Loom-omit>, the sections listed
there will not appear in the final document.  (Unless they appeared in
the document, in which case they will be with the other C<*>
sections.)

If the document contains C<=for Pod::Loom-insert_before>, the sections
listed there will be inserted before the last section in the list
(which must already be in the section list).  If the sections were
already in the section list, they are moved to the new location.

If the document contains C<=for Pod::Loom-insert_after>, the sections
listed there will be inserted after the first section in the list.
For example,

  =for Pod::Loom-insert_after
  DESCRIPTION
  NOTES

will cause the NOTES section to appear immediately after the DESCRIPTION.

Returns the value of each attribute specified in C<@attribute_names>.
If any attribute is C<undef>, dies with a message that

=method weave

  $new_pod = $tmp->weave(\$old_pod, $filename);

This is the primary entry point, normally called by Pod::Loom's
C<weave> method.

First, it stores the filename in the C<tmp_filename> attribute.

It then calls:

=over

=item 1.

L</"parse_pod"> to parse the POD.

=item 2.

L</"post_parse"> to do additional processing.

=item 3.

L</"expect_sections"> to get the list of section titles.

=item 4.

L</"collect_sections"> to get the text of each section from
the original document.

=item 5.

L</"generate_pod"> to produce the new document.

=back

=cut

sub weave
{
  my ($self, $podRef, $filename) = @_;

  $self->tmp_filename($filename);

  $self->parse_pod($podRef);

  $self->post_parse;

  my $sectionList = $self->expect_sections;

  $self->generate_pod($sectionList, $self->collect_sections($sectionList));
} # end weave
#---------------------------------------------------------------------

=method parse_pod

  $tmp->parse_pod(\$pod);

Parse the document, which is passed by reference.  The default
implementation splits up the POD using L<Pod::Loom::Parser>, breaking
it up according to L</"collect_commands">.  The resulting chunks are
stored in the C<tmp_collected> attribute.

=cut

sub parse_pod
{
  my ($self, $podRef) = @_;

  my $pe = Pod::Loom::Parser->new( $self->collect_commands );
  # We can't use read_string, because that treats the string as
  # encoded in UTF-8, for which some byte sequences aren't valid.
  # Pod::Loom::Parser will determine the actual encoding.
  open my $handle, '<:encoding(iso-8859-1)', $podRef
      or die "error opening string for reading: $!";
  $pe->read_handle($handle);
  $self->tmp_collected( $pe->collected );
  $self->tmp_encoding(  $pe->encoding  );
  $self->tmp_groups(    $pe->groups    );
} # end parse_pod
#---------------------------------------------------------------------

=method post_parse

  $tmp->post_parse()

This method is called after C<parse_pod>.  The default implementation
sorts the collected POD chunks if requested to by the document or the
C<sort_> attributes.

=cut

sub post_parse
{
  my ($self) = @_;

  $self->_sort_collected;
} # end post_parse
#---------------------------------------------------------------------

=method collect_sections

  $section_text = $tmp->collect_sections($section_list)

This method collects the text of each section in the original document
based on the $section_list (which comes from L</"expect_sections">).
It returns a hashref keyed on section title.

Any sections that appeared in the original document but are not in
C<$section_list> are concatenated to form the C<*> section.

=diag C<< Can't find heading in %s >>

(F) Pod::Loom couldn't determine the section title for the specified
section.  Is it formatted properly?

=cut

sub collect_sections
{
  my ($self, $sectionList) = @_;

  # Split out the expected sections:

  my %expectedSection = map { $_ => 1 } @$sectionList;

  my $heads = $self->tmp_collected->{head1};
  my %section;

  foreach my $h (@$heads) {
    $h =~ /^=head1\s+(.+?)(?=\n*\z|\n\n)/
        or $self->error("Can't find heading in $h");
    my $title = $1;

    if ($expectedSection{$title}) {
      warn "Duplicate section $title" if $section{$title};
      $section{$title} .= $h;
    } else {
      $section{'*'} .= $h;
    }
  } # end foreach $h in @$heads

  return \%section;
} # end collect_sections
#---------------------------------------------------------------------

=method generate_pod

  $pod = $tmp->generate_pod($section_list, $section_text)

This method is passed a list of section titles (from
L</"expect_sections">) and a hash containing the original text of each
section (from L</"collect_sections">.  It then considers each section
in order:

=over

=item 1.

If the section appeared in the original document, it calls
C<< $tmp->override_section($title) >>.  If that returns false,
it copies the section from the original document to the new document
and proceeds to the next section.  Otherwise, it continues to step 2.

=item 2.

It calls C<< $tmp->method_for_section($title) >> to get the method
that will handle that section.  If that returns no method, it proceeds
to the next section.

=item 3.

It calls the method from step 2, passing it two parameters: the
section title and the text of the section from the original document
(or undef).  Whatever text the method returns is appended to the new
document.  (The method may return the empty string, but should not
return undef).

=back

=cut

sub generate_pod
{
  my ($self, $sectionList, $sectionText) = @_;

  # Now build the new POD:
  my $pod = '';

  foreach my $title (@$sectionList) {
    if ($sectionText->{$title} and not $self->override_section($title)) {
      $pod .= $sectionText->{$title};
    } # end if document supplied section and we don't override it
    else {
      my $method = $self->method_for_section($title);

      $pod .= $self->$method($title, $sectionText->{$title})
          if $method;
    } # end else let method generate section

    # Make sure the document ends with a blank line:
    $pod =~ s/\n*\z/\n\n/ if $pod;
  } # end foreach $title in @$sectionList

  my $encoding = $self->tmp_encoding;
  if (length $pod) {
    $pod = $encoding->encode($pod);
    my $name = $encoding->name;
    $pod = "=encoding " . $encoding->encode($name) . "\n\n$pod"
        unless $name eq 'iso-8859-1';
  }

  $pod;
} # end generate_pod
#---------------------------------------------------------------------

=method method_for_section

  $methodRef = $tmp->method_for_section($section_title);

This associates a section title with the template method that
implements it.  By default, it prepends C<section_> to the title, and
then converts any non-alphanumeric characters to underscores.

The special C<*> section is associated with the method C<other_sections>.

=cut

sub method_for_section
{
  my ($self, $title) = @_;

  # Generate the method name:
  my $method = "section_$title";
  if ($title eq '*') { $method = "other_sections" }
  else {
    $method =~ s/[^A-Z0-9_]/_/gi;
  }

  # See if we actually have a method by that name:
  $self->can($method);
} # end method_for_section
#---------------------------------------------------------------------

=method joined_section

  $podText = $tmp->joined_section($oldcmd, $newcmd, $title, $pod);

This method may be useful to subclasses that want to build sections
out of collected commands.  C<$oldcmd> must be one of the entries from
L</"collect_commands">.  C<$newcmd> is the POD command that should be
used for each entry (like C<head2> or C<item>).  C<$title> is the
section title, and C<$pod> is the text of that section from the
original document (if any).

Each collected entry is appended to the original section.  If there
was no original section, a simple C<=head1 $title> command is added.
If C<$newcmd> is C<item>, then C<=over> and C<=back> are added
automatically.

If the document divided this section into groups (see
L</"Pod::Loom-group_COMMAND">), that is handled automatically by this
method.  If C<$newcmd> is a C<headN>, and any of the category headers
contains a C<=headN> command, then C<$newcmd> is automatically
incremented.  (E.g., C<head2> becomes C<head3>).

=cut

sub joined_section
{
  my ($self, $cmd, $newcmd, $title, $pod) = @_;

  my $entries = $self->tmp_collected->{$cmd};

  return ($pod || '') unless ($entries and @$entries)
                          or ($groups  and %$groups);

  $pod = "=head1 $title\n" unless $pod;

  return $self->_join_groups($cmd, $newcmd, $title, $pod, $groups)
      if $groups and %$groups;

=diag C<< Found Pod::Loom-group_%s in %s, but no groups were used >>

(S) You indicated that a command (like C<=method>) was going to be
grouped, but didn't actually use any groups.

  return $pod . $self->join_entries($newcmd, $entries);
} # end joined_section
#---------------------------------------------------------------------

=method join_entries

  $podText = $tmp->join_entries($newcmd, \@entries);

This method is used by L</"joined_section">, but may be useful to
subclasses also.  Each element of C<@entries> must begin with a POD
command, which will be changed to C<$newcmd>.  It returns the entries
joined together, surrounded by C<=over> and C<=back> if C<$newcmd> is
C<item>.

=cut

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Pod::Loom::Template is intended as the standard base class for
Pod::Loom templates.  It provides the engine that splits apart the POD
and reassembles it.  The subclass needs to specify how the POD is
reassembled.  See the L</"weave"> method for details.

=head2 Controlling the template

A POD document can contain special commands for the template.  These
commands should work with all templates based on Pod::Loom::Template.
They are placed in a C<=for> command, and must not come in the middle
of a section.

=over

=item Pod::Loom-insert_after

=item Pod::Loom-insert_before

Insert (or move) one or more sections into the specified position.
See L</"expect_sections">.

=item Pod::Loom-omit

Omit the specified sections from the document.
See L</"expect_sections">.

=item Pod::Loom-sections

Specify the complete list of sections for the document.
See L</"expect_sections">.

=item Pod::Loom-sort_COMMAND

If a template allows pseudo-POD commands like C<=method>, you can have
the resulting entries sorted alphabetically.  For example, to have
your methods sorted, use

  =for Pod::Loom-sort_method

You can also supply a list of entries (one per line) that should come
first.  The list must match the corresponding entry exactly.  For
example:

  =for Pod::Loom-sort_method
  new

  =method new

or

  =for Pod::Loom-sort_method
  C<< $object = Class->new() >>

  =method C<< $object = Class->new() >>

=item Pod::Loom-group_COMMAND

If you have a lot of attributes or methods, you might want to group
them into categories.  You do this by appending the category (which is
an arbitrary string without whitespace) to the command.  For example:

  =attr-fmt font

says that the font attribute is in the C<fmt> category.  You must have
a C<Pod::Loom-group_COMMAND> block for each category you use.  The
block begins with the category name on a line by itself.  The rest of
the block (which may be blank) is POD that will appear before the
associated entries.

  =begin Pod::Loom-group_attr fmt

  =head2 Formatting Attributes

  These attributes control formatting.

Note: Because Pod::Eventual is not a full-fledged POD parser, you do
not actually need a matching C<=end> after the C<=begin>, but it won't
hurt if you use one.  If you don't, the block ends at the next POD
command in L</"collect_commands">.

Entries that do not contain a category are placed in the special
category C<*>.

The categories will be listed in the order that the
Pod::Loom-group_COMMAND blocks appear in the document.  The order of
entries within each category is controlled as usual.  See
L</"Pod::Loom-sort_COMMAND">.  (Just ignore the category when defining
the sort order.)

=item Pod::Loom-template

Specify the template for the document.  (This is actually handled by
L<Pod::Loom>, and applies to all templates, whether or not they
subclass Pod::Loom::Template.)
